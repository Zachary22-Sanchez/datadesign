<p>John is a 32yo food critic and writter. He has recently moved to Albuquerque, NM and has been trying all the
different foods the city has to offer. He has had some good and some bad experiences and has been adding up
his data and information to post onto different sites for others to view. He has recently been working on Yelp
to post his food reviews. He is not very tech savy and mostly uses his mobile phone to access sites and post reviews.
He needs to be able to access the site quickly and enter a review on the go to get to the next food spot.</p>
